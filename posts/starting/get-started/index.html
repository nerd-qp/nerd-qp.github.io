I plan to publish at
least once a month. My posts will be mostly about interesting
Mathematical problems. Sometimes, there will be some posts involving
computing, expect heterogeneous computation topics like GPGPU. As
inspired by <a href=https://francisbach.com/>Francis Bach</a>, I plan to release every first
Monday of the month. Overall, I hope this blog can be helpful.</p><h2 id=auto-1>1<span style=margin-left:1em></span>Why Math and how to interpret them?<span style=margin-left:1em></span></h2><p>This is actually a question that I have been thinking ever since I read
the paper \(A^{\ast}\) sampling &ndash; it is a beautiful algorithm with
theoretical guarantees, but what is the use case of this algorithm. This
problem constantly frustrates me, because I feel that taking a lot of
effort in reading papers helps so little in my research. Even now, I
don't know when I will ever use this algorithm. In other words, I cannot
justify spending time and energy reading papers. Sometimes, I feel
stupid to spend huge amount of time on something that does not directly
benefit me. It feels like that I use this time for playing video games
(or just to have fun), but with a purpose of actually putting it into
practical use. But when I look back, this has never been my first
&ldquo;fail&rdquo; investment, which raises another problem hidden in
plain sight &ndash; why do I keep doing this and should I keep doing
this?</p><p>As it turns out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_L-fp8gDzY">Grant Sanderson</a> has figured it out for me,
at least partially. In his talk, titled &ldquo;What Makes People Engage
With Math?&rdquo;, he talked about why the most viewed videos of his
channel are not something as practical as &ldquo;Nerual Network&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Fourier Transform&rdquo;. The reason behind this, and he made
a brilliant analogy, &ldquo;when reading Harry Potter, when will I ever
use Wingardium Leviosa?&rdquo;, is similar to the reason people read
novel and fiction. &ldquo;It's about emotion, it's about wonder, and
it's about a mystery that you just need to see resolved.&rdquo; This
inspires me, working out Mathematical problems is not that much
different from reading other forms of materials. It attracts you from
another angle. Peeling off the obscure veil of Mathematical symbols, it
prompts you a question that you have to see resolved. The more peculiar
the problem is, the more engagement one will put in. This is one of the
reasons I keep pushing myself into these pits.</p><p>On the other hand, I have to admit, my initial attempt at this line of
research is due to it is hard, and if it is hard, then I would outsmart
other people, then I would prove my value in the community. This
dangerous thought has led me into a rabbit hole. In retrospect, no one
would ever deliberately take on a career just because it is challenging.
Everyone wants a simple and happy life. Only a fool like me would do
that just to outsmart other people. Then again, it is a tempting
thought. Gradually, I realize that scientific research is about sharing,
not showing off. When presented with a difficult path and a simple path,
I should take the simple path. This means that if I encounter a paper or
other media that is hard to follow through and the problem it's trying
to solve doesn't attract me enough, I should stop. I shouldn't read it
because it's hard.</p><p>Another problem I find in reading papers is that I only seek to
understand the symbols of equations, or I just derive of how equations
come up, but I don't look for deeper understanding, or how I would
describe this paper without mathematical notations, i.e., what is the
intuition behind all these complicated symbols. This is a serious
problem I uncover lately. I am always trying to interpret problems in
math symbols, which are the most obscure things ever created by human.
No one talks or thinks like that! We use them because it serves the
purpose &ndash; it is precise, it causes no ambiguity. But at the same
time, they thwart people from accessing the true nature of the problem.
Now, whenever I read a paper, I should form a hierarchy of
understanding. At the bottom, I should know how each equation is
derived. At the top, I should describe the main idea in plain language,
where it is easy for me to think and work on. And I should emphasize
more on the high level part, whlie, sometimes minor mathematical details
should be ignored. What is funny about the phrase &ldquo;deep
understanding&rdquo; is that it is actually not anything deep. Instead,
it is usually a simple idea extracted from all the mass presented to you
(usually a paper).</p><p>Reading a paper is like taking a treat from a tall shelf. I should
consider how to balance between how hard I should try, and whether it is
worthy or not. Besides, I would put more focus on deeper understanding
rather than mathematical notations. Those notations are merely means of
transferring knowledge. What's important is the knowledge underneath
them.</p></body></html></div></div></section><footer class=footer><div class="content has-text-centered"><p><a href=https://github.com/orf/bare-hugo-theme target=_blank>Bare Hugo theme.</a></p></div></footer><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','Ua-139857559-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
